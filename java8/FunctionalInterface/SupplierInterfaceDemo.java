// The Supplier functional interface is also a type of functional interface that does not take any input or argument and 
// yet returns a single output. This type of functional interface is generally used in the lazy generation of values. 
// Supplier functional interfaces are also used for defining the logic for the generation of any sequence. 
// For example â€“ The logic behind the Fibonacci Series can be generated with the help of the Stream. 
// generate method, which is implemented by the Supplier functional Interface. 

// The different extensions of the Supplier functional interface hold many other suppliers functions like BooleanSupplier, 
// DoubleSupplier, LongSupplier, and IntSupplier. The return type of all these further specializations is their corresponding 
// primitives only.
